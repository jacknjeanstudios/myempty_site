Good Morning Mutty,

I find myself trying to get into your head these days. I think about how the last few months I would tell you how you needed to engage and that if I didn't hear your voice, even a simple "morning" (it was never good morning because you hated them all) and I could assess how you were doing just by the tone of your voice. I think that part of my day is the part I miss the most. Not knowing how your doing.

Dad is finding his way. Last night he went to a ball game.

The day you left us you had plans to go to a game with him. I think its good ... and I think its sad ... and I think like always dad needs to be surrounded by people. He finds comfort in people. He recharges in their midst. I find comfort in solitude. How did we end up together? Two such highly contrasting opposites.

I think about how we could frustrate the shit out of each other, you and I ... but when you wanted to be left alone, I tended to hover ever closer until I got answers ... and if I wanted to be left alone, well by God, people better just damn well leave me alone. I'm sorry if I smothered you. You were always my worry wart. Josey and I talk about how that is gone now. That weight that sits just at the back of your head, that constant pull ... that constant concern of "Is she okay?" ... I never realized how much it was there until it was no longer there. I would carry it again tho to share another good day with you. But in the end hunny, even the good moments were just so fleeting and its been along time since you had had a good day.

Josey said "I think life will be better now, Mom... but I think it will be harder too." We won't miss the medical crap, the overwhelming urge to shame the people who were cruel to you, the long days and nights at the hospital, the 85 mile drive one way, the cost, the everything that goes with all of something like this. But we will always miss you.

I spoke with Robert Adhoot (the Yay Math! guy) yesterday afternoon. I have so much respect for that man, Heather ... I feel about him kind of like I feel about you. Did you know they are expecting another babe around Thanksgiving? He cried with me on the phone. You have touched so many people.

So genuine.

To be a light to others in this world is something I think we all posses and are capable of, but sometimes we are just so broken we can barely torch our own path thru this shit show we call life. I remember, even when you were in the hospital, the gal who came to clean your room, even her you tried to make her day brighter, when yours was miserable... and then Tony, the food service guy ... he came to tell me the day of your last xplant he was praying for us... and the gal who asked permission to procure your old liver came while we waited thru your surgery because of the conversation we had during the procurement process. Brian, the security guard, who would stop in to check up on you... and how he showed up in the family room as I sat alone waiting for them to get your lines started. He too cried with me... so many weep with me.
You. Touched. So. Many. People.

I get it now. I get that even when life is a shit sandwich even a simple touch, glance, smile can make all the difference to one other human being... and then that day was worth living and a huge success.
Its going to be a good day.

I love you Mutty, So much, I love you.

Love, Mom

PS. So what was that about "death" again?
