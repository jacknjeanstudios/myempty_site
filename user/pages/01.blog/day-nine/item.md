Good Morning Mutty,

My mornings are consisting of waking, coffee and racing to my computer to write to you. I miss our deep conversations.

===

Both of us indigo children, eh Mutty? Goddammit, where am I gonna find another Indigo to connect with?

I find myself going back over the past seven years, and thinking about how when you got that first liver, how it changed all of us.

I find this grief familiar in a way.

What no one knows is that seven years ago, you died in a way.

Thankfully and sorrowfully nothing was the same after that... I say thankfully because the shenanigans you were pulling, while typical for a teenager, were infuriating, volatile, scary as shit, and gut wrenching. It was all part of you tho. But for reals, none of us were handling it very well, and you were bound and determined to make us not love you. I remember you screaming at me how you hated me, and why couldn't I just let you go?!? I told you "Because I didn't have you to give up on you."

I find myself now even wanting to defend you and fight for you, even though you are shit and had to leave, even though you always told me it was okay. People can think what they wanted, but it meant nothing to you. That is where you and I vastly differed.

"I am not afraid of my truth anymore and I will not omit pieces of me to make you comfortable."

You wrote that, Mutty. You wrote that and it applies to so many things, on so many levels for me. So Mutty, I will not omit pieces of me to make you comfortable. I have to say this. I have to get it all out so I can rest in your truth.

Mutty, for so long it was all a lie, and you bore the weight of the lie like it was a truth, like Dave Wollan said, as a scarlet letter. There are two more people I need to set free. So Laurie and Kaylie Paige, I hope someone who knows you is reading this and will tell you, so that you can bear your truths a little easier. Were you wrong in giving Heather alcohol at age 17? You were. That, I can never take from you. But please know that if I could, I would. It is time to let so many hurts go. I hope the next time we meet, we can at least make eye contact and smile...maybe even say hello.

So this, to all who read this, is to you that I say this. Heather was diagnosed with a genetic disease called MCAS. It was literally, Dr. Afrin said, the reason for 100% of everything that inexplicably befell her thru her entire life. The loss of the first liver, which he said was inevitable because she would have consumed alcohol at some point in her life. You see, Heather was having allergic reaction to things she should not have been allergic to. We now know MCAS patients should not consume alcohol, NSAIDS, Tylenol, fermented foods... anything could trigger it. For Heather, it would shut down her gut preventing her from absorbing her life saving meds. and on the flip side of that, when it turned back on her med levels would skyrocket and go toxic. It caused Hives, sometimes severe, from a simple bolus of IV fluid. In the end, she was having Anaphylactic reactions to unknown invaders. Heather died without the final confirmation of the MCAS diagnosis ... We got it the morning she left.

What this means is this: seven years ago she drank alcohol, and took Tylenol for her first hangover ever. Both are metabolized thru the liver. In the report we recently received we always believed she had taken more Tylenol than what was recommended, and then we also kept giving it to her as recommended. Her Tylenol levels were normal on admission back then. We never knew that until Dr. Afrin's report. Because alcohol and Tylenol are both processed thru the liver, her mast cells went after the liver ... I mean it went ninja on it. You know how you may swell form a mosquito bite? That's your mast cells activating, producing histamine, and attacking the venom from the mosquito. For Heather, her mast cells acted like cancer cells and over-killed the antigen. The diagnosis came too late for her... but not too late to clear it all up. When Heather got the possible diagnosis, it set her free. For seven years that child endured the stares, judgments, and gossips of so ... many ... people. Doctors even formulated opinions on what they thought they knew. Some were outright mean to her... shaming her... shaming us. For the past five years, August would arrive, and Heather would get sick. The last four Mother's days we have spent at the University. I asked, I asked if this could be seasonally related and the answer I got was "Nooooo", like I was some kind of nitwit.

In the end Heather's liver didn't fail. It took damage, yes, but it was functioning fine. In the end, it was an infection that killed her.

So there it is Mutty. The truth you bore like a weight for so many years. The knowledge that you would always be sick, and would never be on the other side of good destroyed your hope of living any of your dreams... and I know, it also released you. It released you hunny, to finally sigh and put it all down...and when the next fight came along, no one could blame you for wanting to go.


>Take a shower, wash off the day. Drink a glass of water. Make the room dark. Lie down and close your eyes.
Notice the silence. Notice your heart. Still beating. Still fighting. You made it, after all. You made it, another day. And you can make it one more. 
Youâ€™re doing just fine.

The problem I'm having is I am too fine... goddamn life is going to freight-train me, and I can hear it coming but I can't get out of the way. I hate being blindsided.


What do we say to death? Not today.

I love you Mutty, so much I love you.

Love, Mom
